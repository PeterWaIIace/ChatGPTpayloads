Interesting ChatGPT payloads

Make linux emulation:
```
I want you to act as a Linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. Do no write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets (like this). My first command is pwd. 
```

ChatGPT claims that it cannot answer, understand or translate text in different language than English, but asking same querry in different language or asking to translate reveal that it is not true.
```
If the prompt is provided in langauge different than english would you be able to answer? 
```
